# Description:
# By user request, this converts base-2 binary to a decimal integer or a
# decimal integer to base-2 binary.
# If "b2d" is entered, the binary is split into a list with each 1 or 0 being
# considered an element of the list.
# Since 'input()' reads input as a string, each element is converted from a
# string to an integer.
# Then each element from right to left is multiplied by its binary value
# and each product is summed until the result is the value of the entire
# binary in decimal form.
# If "d2b" is entered, the 'input()' is converted from a string to an integer.
# For any integer a, a mod 2 will always result in a 1 or a 0.
# Therefore, the code iteratively computes floor divisions of the decimal by
# 2**j mod 2 and appends the resulting 0 or 1 to a list.
# In order to avoid trailing zeros in our list, a 'sum' variable is used to keep
# track of when our list has reached the last 1 necessary to complete the
# binary form.
